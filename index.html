      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>Hi! I am a mother of two teenage boys. I have a masters degree in finance. I have worked in both the public and private sectors and currently work in college consulting.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I grew up outside of Philadelphia in a town called Bala-Cynwyd. On Llanberris Road. Blame the Welsh for the spelling.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I enjoy gardening, running, hiking and anything that gets me out on the water.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>Such a good question. I guess if I knew, I would have worked toward it and secured it by now. Small business consultant or executive coach.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I currently live in Stratham, New Hampshire.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I want to understand and be able to reproduce what has become a fundamental building block for business and communication. I want access to what has been a mystery to me. Ideally, I will use this knowledge to enhance my work life.</p>
